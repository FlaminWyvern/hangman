  C Programming Language Project 2: Hangman

  I decided to implement another popular game, being Hangman. 
  
  How it (should) work :) 
-   The user will attempt to guess all the letters in a hidden word by entering letters one at a time
-   If the user types a letter that the word contains, the word would reveal the letter, enabling the user to come up with more guesses
-   If not, the man on the gallow would slowly start to hang by placing one body part per incorrect guess
-   If the user guesses the word correctly, the hanging would stop :)
-   Else, once all the body parts are on the gallow, the man DIES :O


Enjoy!
